My config files

## Active used configs

### Neovim lua config
After using several IDEs and Vim I ended up using Neovim as my PDE (Personal Development Environment.)
[NeoVim Readme](/.config/nvim/README.md)

### lazygit

### wezterm

## Older configs

Tools I used some time on my way to the perfect development setup.

### zellij
A terminal multiplexer with a nice and easy TUI. It has a very low learning curve but after some time I wanted to get
my screen space back to use it for my work and not for help text.

### tmux

### vimrc

## Scripts

### cht.sh

This script can be used to look up information from the cht.sh website.

## Colors

I like the Gruvbox dark Colorscheme. Therefore I have the colors as iTerm colors and in a simply json format.
I use these colors in my wezterm statusbar.
