-- plenary.nvim
-- All the lua functions I don't want to write twice.
-- Note that this library is useless outside of Neovim since it requires 
-- Neovim functions. It should be usable with any recent version of Neovim though.
-- At the moment, it is very much in pre-alpha ðŸ˜„ Expect changes to the way 
-- some functions are structured. I'm hoping to finish some document generators 
-- to provide better documentation for people to use and consume and then at 
-- some point we'll stabilize on a few more stable APIs.
