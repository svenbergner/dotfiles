Fast and feature-rich surround actions
https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.surround

- Actions (all of them are dot-repeatable out of the box and respect v:count 
  for searching surrounding) with configurable keymappings:
  - Add surrounding with sa (in visual mode or on motion).
  - Delete surrounding with sd.
  - Replace surrounding with sr.
  - Find surrounding with sf or sF (move cursor right or left).
  - Highlight surrounding with sh.
  - Change number of neighbor lines with sn (see |MiniSurround-algorithm|).

- Surrounding is identified by a single character as both "input" 
  (in delete and replace start, find, and highlight) and "output" 
  (in add and replace end):
  - 'f' - function call (string of alphanumeric symbols or '_' or '.' 
    followed by balanced '()'). In "input" finds function call, in "output" 
    prompts user to enter function name.
  - 't' - tag. In "input" finds tag with same identifier, in "output" prompts 
    user to enter tag name.

  - All symbols in brackets '()', '[]', '{}', '<>". In "input' represents 
    balanced brackets (open - with whitespace pad, close - without), 
    in "output" - left and right parts of brackets.

  - '?' - interactive. Prompts user to enter left and right parts.

  - All other alphanumeric, punctuation, or space characters represent 
    surrounding with identical left and right parts.

- Configurable search methods to find not only covering but possibly next, 
  previous, or nearest surrounding. See more in help for MiniSurround.config.

- All actions involving finding surrounding (delete, replace, find, highlight) 
  can be used with suffix that changes search method to find previous/last.
