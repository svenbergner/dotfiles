Better Escape

A lot of people have mappings like jk or jj to escape insert mode.
The problem with this mappings is that whenever you type a j, neovim wait
about 100-500ms (depending on your timeoutlen) to see, if you type a j or a k
because these are mapped. Only after that time the j will be inserted.
Then you always get a delay when typing a j.
An example where this has a big impact is e.g. telescope.
Because the characters which are mapped aren't really inserted at first the
whole filtering isn't instant.
