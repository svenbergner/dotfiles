Neovim Treesitter context
A Neovim plugin that shows the context of the currently visible buffer contents. 
It's supposed to work on a wide range of file types, but is probably most useful 
when looking at source code files. In most programming languages this context 
will show you which function you're looking at, and within that function which 
loops or conditions are surrounding the visible code.
